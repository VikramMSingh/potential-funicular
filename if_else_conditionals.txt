To check whether a value is in a list
x= ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

if A in x:
    print("True")

To check whether a value is not in the list
x=['A','B','C','D']

if E not in x:
    print(f"{E} is missing)

use multiple if blocks if you want to evaluate multiple things without breaking the loop. - can replace with for loop  

if-elif-else block will exit even if one condition is met so not ideal for evaluating multiple conditions

To verify if a list is not empty:
if list:
    for x in list:
        print(f"Elements of the list are {x}")
    else:
        print("Empty list")
