Slicing lists
To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]). This tells Python to make a slice that starts at the first item and ends with the last item, produc- ing a copy of the entire list.
For example, imagine we have a list of our favorite foods and want to make a separate list of foods that a friend likes. This friend likes everything in our list so far, so we can create their list by copying ours:
u my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake'] vfriend_foods = my_foods[:]
   print("My favorite foods are:")
   print(my_foods)
   print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
   print(friend_foods)
: - is used to slice a list
so to seperate a string s = "vikram singh"
we can use s[:].split:
to print as vikram
            singh

if exclude split it will print each alphabet on a different line 

x[0:3] - from 0, 1, 2 of list
x[:4] - First 4 of list excluding the 4th index
x[1:] - From 1st index omitting 0 till end
x[-3:] - Last 3 of the list

Looping through slice
for i in x[:3]:
 print(i)

Copying a list
x=[1,3,4]
y = x[:]
print(y)
#[1,3,4]

Both these lists are different - just copied, if we modify x the changes will not reflect in y

For it to reflect in both lists - 
x = y
