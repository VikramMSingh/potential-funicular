Slicing lists
x[0:3] - from 0, 1, 2 of list
x[:4] - First 4 of list excluding the 4th index
x[1:] - From 1st index omitting 0 till end
x[-3:] - Last 3 of the list

Looping through slice
for i in x[:3]:
 print(i)

Copying a list
x=[1,3,4]
y = x[:]
print(y)
#[1,3,4]

Both these lists are different - just copied, if we modify x the changes will not reflect in y

For it to reflect in both lists - 
x = y
