Tuple is an immutable list, i.e unlike the contents of a list, contents of a tuple cannot be modified.

List is defined as x=[1,2] - by square brackets
Tuple is defined as x=(1,2) - by round brackets or parentheses

If defining a tuple with single element:
my_tup = (95,)

Writing over a tuple:

dimensions = (200,50)

dimensions = (250, 500)

This will overwrite the original tuple - dimension from (200,50) to (250,500)
